This demonstrates an href example that does different things depending on if clicked or if opened in a new window:

If clicked:
- javascript function is invoked
- href is NOT navigated to
- key to stopping href navigation is the return false

If opened in a new tab/window:
- subapp.html is opened in the new tab
- javascript function is NOT invoked
