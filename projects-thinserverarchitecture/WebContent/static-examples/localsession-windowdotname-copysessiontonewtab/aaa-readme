So basically this is a failure.

Unless window.open opens the new tab filling in the window.opener reference, there's no way 
to ref back to the original window to copy it's session with window.name.

The localsession java applet could do it since it can see everyone's sessions.

So "subapp" / new tabs would need to have all the necessary info from the current session encoded on the GET url. 

A post request of the localsession contents could be passed through the server and the localsession included in the
generated content of the new page. 

Some interesting beginnings to parsing urls into the querystring, httpargs, etc. though. Would like a better library
from the intarweb somewhere.
