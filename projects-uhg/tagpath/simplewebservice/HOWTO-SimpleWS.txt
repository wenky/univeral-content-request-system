Simple web service: an attempt to do WS simply without unnecessary abstraction models.

Basic idea: 
  RequestGenerator impl creates web service message string
  SimpleWebService impl invokes the webservice ususally with HttpClient
  ResponseParser impl parses the response stream
  
Typical steps:
  - use SOAPUI to get a typical request xml and response xml
    - for unsigned WESB SOAP, you'll need the action   
  - create a MVEL template text file for the request xml
  - write a response parser, usually extends one of the XPath base ones that does the muckity muck of 
    parsing the response, I usually use a sequence of XPaths once the initial XPath navigation has been done
  - write a test to do an invoke
  - write formal unit tests of the RequestGenerator and ResponseParsers using known working response sample
  - configure spring beans for Spring webservice 
    - request generator
    - response parser
    - security conf/tokens/etc (depends on simple ws impl type)
    - UUID generation (depends on simple ws impl type)
