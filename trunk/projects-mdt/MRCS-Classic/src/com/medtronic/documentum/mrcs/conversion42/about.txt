These are the classes for the 4.1.2 --> 4.2 upgrade for MRCS in Q1 of 2007. 


The framework is organized in a batch processing style, with programs run at the command line 
to perform conversion operations. 

There are two types of programs: Identifiers and Processors. 

The purpose of identifiers is to identify/classify objects that will need to be processed in a 
specific way, and to write a list of those docbase objects out to an xml file (we'll use XStream 
for simplicity). Those files will be consumed by processors...

Processors take input files produced by identifiers and perform conversion operations. Processors
will output two files as a result: a log/list of successfully converted objects, and a log/list of
objects that failed and may need manual handling. The intention is that these lists may then be 
reused by other processors. The XML format doubles as a reasonable human-readable and human-editable
format for viewing/editing the files. 


--- unfinished/TODO ---
4.1.2 to 4.2 will require:

- identify which objects are in workflows (need to abort those)
  - identifier: select m_mrcs_documents that are in an active workflowj
  - processor: ???
- conversion of pdf format to the new acro format
  - identifier: m_mrcs_documents that have main format of pdf
  - processor: convert pdf to acro
- processing of the retired and obsolete flags now that we don't use states for those
- setting of the conversion history for future reference and support
- reattachment of lifecycles/policies and the appropriate state since there is version incompatibilies with the docapps
- a special fix for some of the EFS documents which have broken version trees in the Approved Copies folders
- user dumps and reapplication...

other fixes (manual, not automated):
- fix relationship name in EFS configs
- create conversion-specific Build2 xmls (these don't create the folder structure)
- moving of folders+cabinets (rather than rebuild using the Build2 scripts)
