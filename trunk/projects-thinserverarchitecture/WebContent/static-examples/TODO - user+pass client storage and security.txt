- cookies? 
- use basic PKI key exchange for encryption?

Threats: 
- sniffers: sniff user/pass creds if unencrypted
- dopplegangers: even if encrypted, user/pass combo can be passed as part of a request to pretend they are part of it
- solution: include IP address in user/pass encryption, must match actual. Does that help? yes if the credential-IP combo is pk encrypted by client.
- services should generally https everything anyway...
